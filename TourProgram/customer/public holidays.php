       <h2>History of New Year's Day</h2>

New Year's Day was originally observed on 15th March in the old Roman Calendar.<br>

It was fixed at 1st January in 153 BCE, by two Roman consuls. The month was named 
Janus after the name of the Roman god of doors and gates. Janus had two faces, 
one facing forward and one looking back, a fitting name for the month at the start of the year.<br>

During the Middle Ages, a number of different Christian feast dates were used
 to mark the New Year, though calendars often continued to display the months 
 in columns running from January to December in the Roman fashion.<br>

    It wasn't until 1582 when the Roman Catholic Church officially
	adopted 1 January as the New Year.<br>

Most countries in Western Europe had officially adopted 1st January 
as New Year's Day even before they adopted the Gregorian calendar.<br>

	   <h2>  When is Myanmar Independence Day?</h2>
	   
	   Independence Day is an annual public holiday in Myanmar on 4 January<br>
	   
	  The holiday marks the date in 1948 when Myanmar proclaimed its independence from Britain
	  Unlike many independence days, this is not Myanmar's National Day. That is celebrated on 10th day
	  following the full moon of the month of Tazaungmone (late November to early December), when
	  student riots in 1920 against British Rule are remembered.<br>
	  
	 <h3> History of Myanmar Independence Day</h3>
	  
	  In 1886, Myanmar (then called Burma) came under British control, with Rangoon 
	 (the capital. now called Yangonbeing an important port situated between India and Singapore.<br>
	 
	 From the earliest days of colonisation, there was a strong feeling of resentment against the rule 
	 of the British, with Buddhist monks playing a key role in the independence movement.<br>
	 
	 Just before the outbreak of World War II, there had been some moves towards autonomy in 1937,
	 when Burma became a separately administered colony of
	 Britain, with Ba Maw appointed as the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma.<br>
	 
	 Some Burmese saw the rise of Japan as an opportunity to gain independence from Britain,
	 and when the conflict started, Ba Maw formed the Burma Independence Army in Japan.<br>
	 
	 The Japanese took Burma by March 1942 and though many Burmese fought initially on the side of
	 the Japanese in World War II, many others fought with the British. The Burmese army even switched 
	 allegiance from Japan to the allied forces in 1945.<br>
	 
	 Following the end of the war and the defeat of Japan, the Panglong Agreement was reached on 
	 the 12 February 1947 which led to the unification of Burma as an independent state.<br>
	 
	 On 4 January 1948, the Union of Burma gained its independence from Britain. Notably it declined to 
	 the join the British Commonwealth. Shan National Sao Shwe Taik became the new country’s first President
	 and U Nu its first Prime Minister.<br>
	 
	 Burma was renamed Myanmar in 1989 by its military government.<br>
	 
	<h4> How is Myanmar Independence Day celebrated?</h4>
	 
	 Festivals and traditional activities are held across the country 
	 to celebrate the date. The capital, Yangon is festooned in patriotic 
	 colours to mark the festivities. Men and women may wear the nation dress of Burma,
	 which consists of a collarless shirt and skirt. <br>

    <h2>When is Myanmar Union Day?</h2>
	
	Union Day is an annual public holiday in Myanmar on 12 February.
	
	The holiday marks the date in 1947 when the Panglong Agreement was
	signed and passed and Burma became a unified country.<br>
	
	<h3>History of Myanmar Union Day</h3>
	
	In 1886, Myanmar (then called Burma) came under British control,
	but the British made a distinction between how central Burma and 
	the the various outlying ethnic groups were ruled.<br>
	
	Following the end of the Second World War, General Aung San, 
	head of the interim Burmese government and representatives from
	the Shan states, the Kachin hills and the Chin hills met in Panglong to determine the future of Burma.<br>
	
	They reached an agreement which was signed and passed on 12 February 1947. The agreement unified Burma 
	and demanded that the British government restore independence to all of Burma. The Panglong agreement
	formed the basis for the creation of the Union of Burma.<br>
	
	The agreement was a key event in the history of Myanmar as it directly led to the creation of Burma as 
	an independent state in January 1948.
	
	While instrumental in the Panglong agreement, Aung San did not live to see Burma gains its independence
	in January 1948. He was assassinated on 19 July 1947.
	
	Burma was renamed Myanmar in 1989 by its military government.<br>

	Buddha ordained these monks and spread the principles of Buddhism. This marked a key event in the development 
	of the religion.
	
	45 years later, on the same full moon in the third lunar month, Buddha again delivered his teachings shortly
	before his death.
	
	This third lunar month on which both events occurred is known in Buddhist Pali language as 'Makha'. 'Bucha',
	means to honour.<br>

	<h2>When is Peasants' Day ?</h2>
	
	Also known as Farmers' Day, Peasants' Day is an annual public holiday in Myanmar on 2 March.
	The holiday is a day to mark and honour the contribution of agriculture and farming to Myanmar.<br>
	
	<h3>History of Peasants' Day</h3>

	Myanmar's main agricultural product is rice and it is one of the biggest exporters of rice in Asia.
	In recent years, the crops and products grown in Myanmar have been diversified to ensure that
	the country is not too dependent on one particular crop.<br>
	
	Peasants' Day also marks the military coup of 1962, when General Ne Win came to power. 
	The military-led government instigated a series of socialist reforms and remained in power until 2011.<br>

	<h2>When is Myanmar Armed Forces Day ?</h2>
	
	Armed Forces Day is observed as a public holiday in Myanmar on 27 March. 
	Known in Myanmar as 'Tatmadaw Nay', it commemorates the rebellion against Japanese occupation during World War II.<br>
	
	<h3>History of Myanmar Armed Forces Day</h3>
	
	In 1886, Myanmar (then called Burma) came under British control. From the earliest days of colonisation,
	there was a strong feeling of resentment against the rule of the British.<br>
	
	During World War II, Some Burmese saw the rise of Japan as an opportunity to gain independence from Britain. 
	Aung San, was a prominent figure in the independence movement, but he been exiled to China. While in exile,
	he agreed to collaborate with Japan, having been convinced they would make Burma an independent nation
	if they helped drive out the British.<br>
	
	With Burmese nationalist support, Japan took control of Burma in 1942.
	However Aung San came to realise that the Japanese had no intention of giving 
	independence to Burma and on 23 March 1945, he led the Burmese army in a a rebellion against 
	the Japanese that helped the Allied forces remove the Japanese from the region. <br>
	
	Not surprisingly, the key event on this day is a large parade by the Tatmadaw, 
	the Myanmar military in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. <br>
	
	Originally this holiday was called Resistance Day, but it was renamed to Armed Forces Day by the Tatmadaw.<br>

	<h2>When is Thingyan ?</h2>
	
	Thingyan is an public holiday in Myanmar usually celebrated over three days beginning on 13 April.
	The public holidays given for each year will depend on which day of the week, 13 April falls on.
	
	Thingyan culminates in the Burmese New Year and the period of holidays are the most important and 
	the biggest festival in Myanmar.
	
	Formerly the dates of Thingyan would have been based on the Burma lunisolar calendar, 
	but the dates have now been fixed on 13 April.<br>
	
	<h3>What are the traditions of Thingyan ?</h3>
	
	Thingyan is is celebrated at the same time as many other New Years in the region. 
	Thingyan historically marked the changing of the year by the sun moving from Pieces to Aries.
	The word Thingyan is thought to have derived from ancient Sanskrit and means 'change'.<br>
	
	This is an ancient festival and when it was first observed, the movement of the sun into Aries 
	would have been closer to the Vernal Equinox (21 March) which marks the arrival of spring in 
	the northern hemisphere. The dates of these events differ today due to the wobble of the earth on
	its axis over a 25,000 cycle - known as procession.<br>
	
	The legend of the origin of Thingyan relates to a argument over a mathematical problem between two gods.
	The loser of this argument had his head cut off. However, when his head hit the ground, the earth would burn;
	if thrown in the sea, the water would dry up and if thrown in the air, it would explode in a fireball.
	To keep this from happening, seven goddesses took turns holding the head for a year each, changing over on Thingyan.
	The winner of the argument cut off the head of an elephant and stuck it on the headless body, thereby creating the god,
	Ganesh.<br>
	
	<h4>How is Thingyan celebrated ?</h4>
	
	Even though Thingyan has now been fixed in mid-April, its current date is a welcome position in the calendar as it occurs
	at the hottest time of the year in Myanmar and being a water festival, it is a great opportunity to cool down and get some 
	relief from the sweltering heat.<br>
	
	If you are in Myanmar during Thingyan, prepare to get wet! Everyone is likely to get soaking as people roam around with
	buckets of water or hose, spraying water on anyone they can. This tradition originates from the custom of washing away 
	the bad luck and misfortune of the previous year, entering the new year cleansed from the past. Water cleansing is
	a custom common in many New Year festivals around the world.<br>
	
	In the 13th century, chronicles from the time that King Narathihapate, the last ruler of the Bagan Dynasty,
	built corridors that ran from his palace to the bank of the Ayeyarwaddy River and that during Thingyan 
	they were used for water throwing.<br>

	<p>
	Buddha Purnima is the most sacred day in the Buddhist calendar. 
	It is the most important festival of the Buddhists, and is celebrated with great enthusiasm. <br>
	
	Although Buddhists regard every full moon as sacred, the moon of the month of Vaisakh has special significance 
	because on this day the Buddha was born, attained enlightenment (nirvana), and attained parinirvana
	(nirvana-after-death of the body) when he died.<br>
	
	Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical founder of Buddhism, was born in India 3,000 years ago.
	There are various opinions concerning the exact dates of his birth and death, but according to Buddhist tradition,
	he is said to have been born April 8, 1029 BC and died on February 15, 949 BC, although other Buddhist scholars 
	place his birth five hundred years later. <br>
	
	Shakyamuni Buddha was the son of the king of the Shakyas, a small clan whose kingdom was located at the foothills of the Himalayas,
	south of what is now central Nepal, fifteen miles from Kapilavastu. Shakya of Shakyamuni is taken from the name of this tribe and muni
	means sage or saint. His family name was Gautama (Best Cow) and his given name was Siddhartha (Goal Achieved) though some scholars say
	this is a title bestowed on him by later Buddhists in honour of the enlightenment he attained. <br>
	
	Even though many Buddhists observe Buddha's historical birth on April 8, the exact date remains in question. 
	Although modern archeological and historical research confirms that Prince Siddartha Gotama lived around this time.<br>
	
	The exact date of Vesak is the first full moon in the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year 
	in the Gregorian calendar, but is typically in May. <br>

	<h2>What is May Day ?</h2>
	
	May day is now most commonly associated as a commemoration of the achievements of the lobour movement. The holiday may also be known
	as Labour Day or International Workers' Day and is marked with a public holiday in over 80 countries.<br>
	The 1 May date is uesd beacuse in 1884 the America Fedreation of Organized Trades and Labour Unions demanded an eight-hour
	workday,to come in effect as of 1 May 1886.This  resulted in the general strike and the Haymarket Riot of 1886, but 
	eventually also in the official sancation of the eight-hour workday.<br>
    1 May is celebrated as May Day in most contries around the world. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the bank holiday isn't fixed
    on May 1st,	 but instead is observed on the first Monday of May.<br>
    In the 20th century, the holiday received the official endorsement of the Soviet Union, and it is also celebrated as the Day of 
	the International Solidarity of Workers, especially in some Communist states. Celebrations in communist countries during
	the Cold War era often consisted of large military parades with the latest weaponry being exhibited as well as shows of common
	people in support of the government.<br>	
	Curiously (given the origin of the 1 May date), the United States celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday of September 
	(1 May is Loyalty Day, a legal but not widely recognized holiday in the United States). There is some suggestion that
	the reason for this was to avoid the commemoration of riots that had occurred in 1886. The adoption of May Day by communists 
	and socialists as their primary holiday have been as a another reason as they further inceased official resistance to May Day 
	labor celebrations in America. <br>
	Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands also celebrate Labour Day on different dates; though that has to do with how
	the holiday originated in those countries.<br>
	May Day has long been a focal point for demonstrations by various communist, socialist, and anarchist groups.<br>
	The first day of May was also a pagan holiday in many parts of Europe, Its roots as a holiday stretch back to the Gaelic Beltane.
	It was considered the last day of winter when the beginning of summer was celebrated. <br>
	During Roman times, 1 May was seen as a key period to celebrate fertility and the arrival of spring. The Roman festival of Flora,
	the goddess of flowers and the season of spring, was held between 28 April and 3 May. <br>

	<h2>When is Myanmar Matyr's Day ?</h2>
	
	Martyrs' Day, also known as Arzarni Day, is observed as a public holiday in Myanmar on 19 July.
	Martyrs' Day commemorates the assassination of General Aung San and several other cabinet members in 1947<br>
	<h3> History of Myanmar Matyr's Day</h3>
	
	In 1886, Myanmar (then called Burma) came under British control. From the earliest days of colonisation, there was a strong feeling of
	resentment against the rule of the British.<br>

    Just before the outbreak of World War II, there had been some moves towards autonomy in 1937, when Burma became a separately administered
     colony of Britain, with Ba Maw appointed as the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma.<br>

    Following the end of World War II, the Panglong Agreement was reached on 12 February 1947, which paved the way for the unification of 
    Burma as an independent state.<br>

    An interim government was formed with General Aung San (whose daughter is Aung San Suu Kyi) as Prime Minister.<br>

    On 19 July 1947, gunmen went into a cabinet meeting and shot dead Aung San and seven other key leaders of the interim government. 
    The assassinations were planned by a political rival, U Saw. Within a few months, U Saw was found guilty and executed.<br>

    Burma gained its independence from British colonial rule on 4 January 1948.<br>
	
	<h4>How is Myanmar Matyr's Day commemorated ?</h4>
	Martyrs’ Day is probably Myanmar’s second most important public holiday.<br>
	On 19 July, To mark the exact time of the shooting, car horns are sounded in the streets of Myanmar at 10.37am.<br>
	High-level government officials will visit the Martyrs’ Mausoleum in Yangon, which is dedicated to Aung San and 
	the others who were killed.<br>
	Aung San Suu Kyi, the General's daughter, was kept under house arrest for 15 years and Martyrs' Day was ignored by the military government.
	With Aung San Suu Kyi's release and role in the governing of Myanmar, attitudes have changed and military chiefs now participate in the ceremonies
	for Martyrs' Day and attend a Buddhist prayer service at Aung San Suu Kyi’s residence.<br>
